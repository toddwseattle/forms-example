# Forms Excercise Due Sept 15th in Class
Please use Stackblitz for this excercise.  The code is mirrored at the link below; where you should fork it and finish with your team.

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-milrsm)

The link to the spreadsheet is provided on [canvas in this assignment](https://ashesi.instructure.com/courses/743/assignments/2492).

## Before Friday Morning: 
Fill in the names of the people in your group. In the top of the spreadsheet; for the number of the breakout you were in at the end of class on ThursdayAgree on a time to meet together online for an hour.If you aren't in a group; find a group with less than 5 people.

## Before class Tuesday:

Work through as much of the task list together, with one person having the project open and sharing the screen with the other 4.

I recommend an hour of time together; but spend no more than 2.

In your last moments together; reflect and record how you did the task---what worked as a team; what didn't.  What was hard; what was easy.To turn the assignment in, indicate the group number you are in and **turn in the link to the stackblitz you created together**.
